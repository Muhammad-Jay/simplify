# Lazarus Cloud Automation Platform

## üåü Overview

The **Lazarus Cloud Automation Platform** is a unified management solution designed to simplify the deployment, scaling, and operational management of high-performance microservice architectures. By introducing a node-based flow visualization, Lazarus transforms complex service orchestration into an intuitive, connected platform.

Our goal is to abstract the complexities of containerization and multi-service deployment, allowing developers to manage an entire application ecosystem from a single, cohesive interface.

## üí° Key Features

**Lazarus is built to make microservice management easier and more connected:**

### 1. Unified Node-Based Visualization

* **Intuitive Architecture:** Visualize each individual microservice as a manageable Node, providing a clear, top-down view of your entire application's structure.


* **Dependency Mapping:** Easily understand the relationships and dependencies between different containerized services within the platform.

### 2. Streamlined Container Management

* **Podman-Powered:** Leverages Podman for secure, rootless, and efficient containerization of diverse application languages and runtimes.


* **One-Click Control:** Effortlessly deploy, stop, or restart individual containers directly through the visual interface.


* **Scalability:** Quickly create new instances of specific container nodes to handle load and ensure high availability.

### 3. Integrated Developer Workflow

- **Built-in CLI Agent**: The companion command-line tool serves as a lightweight agent, allowing developers to push and deploy code changes directly from their local environment (IDE/Terminal).


- **GitHub Repository Linking**: Seamlessly integrate with existing GitHub repositories for CI/CD pipelines, enabling continuous deployment based on code commits.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The platform is engineered using modern, robust, and scalable technologies:

- **Primary Language**: TypeScript

- **Container Engine**: Podman

- **Core UI/Flow**:¬†Next JS, React-flow

## üõ£Ô∏è Project Motivation & Future Plans

The Lazarus Platform was created to solve the persistent pain points of managing complex, highly-distributed applications where tooling and observability are often fragmented.

##### Future development plans include:

* Adding deep-dive metrics and logging visualization for individual node performance.


* Extending support for remote cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) beyond local container orchestration.


* Implementing automatic resource allocation and scaling based on real-time traffic analysis.
